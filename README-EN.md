### What is Rise of Nations
Rise of Nations is a Roblox experience that aims to be a free variant of the popular strategy game Hearts of Iron IV in the modern age.
In Rise of Nations, the player chooses a country of his choice and tries to achieve global domination.
For this, each country has different advantages and disadvantages. Some countries start with a stronger economy, more troops or more resources than other countries. Also, the geographical location of a country plays a big role on the difficulty of achieving global domination or similar.

## Wars
### Conquest
A Conquest War or a War of Conquest aims at conquering the country to be attacked and is the most used type of war among players. At the end of the war, the following options are available in the peace treaty:
- Annex Cities _You get all the cities of the enemy country_
- Seize State Treasury _You gain all the money of the enemy country_
- Seize State [Resources](#ressourcen) _You get all the resources of the enemy country_
- Demand War Reperations _You Recieve war reparations from the enemy country_

### Liberation
A Liberation War aims to liberate countries or the people who are under the control of another country. For this purpose, the following options are available in the peace treaty at the end of the war:
- Seize State Treasury _You gain all the money of the enemy country_
- Seize State [Resources](#ressourcen) _You get all the resources of the enemy country_
- Demand War Reperations _You Recieve war reparations from the enemy country_
- Enforce Ideology _You impose a different ideology on the opposing country. (e.g. communism, democracy etc.)_
- Liberate Countries _You **liberate** all the lands that the enemy country has previously conquered._
- Disarm Military _You disarm the enemy country_

### Subjugation
A subjugation war or subjugation war aims at making the country to be attacked a puppet state. For this purpose, the following options are available in the peace treaty at the end of the war:
- Seize State Treasury _You gain all the money of the enemy country_
- Seize State [Resources](#ressourcen) _You get all the resources of the enemy country_
- Demand War Reperations _You Recieve war reparations from the enemy country_
- Enforce Ideology _You impose a different ideology on the opposing country. (e.g. communism, democracy etc.)_
- Puppet Nation _You are turning the country into a puppet state of yours._
- Disarm Military _You disarm the enemy country_

## Ground units
### Infantry
The infantry is an all-rounder. It can attack and defend well. With the appropriate upgrades or research, you can make the infantry even more effective in their work. You can use transport planes to move infantry through the air faster and get them to remote places quickly. A unit of infantry consists of 20k soldiers.
It is slowed down and damaged by vegitation, mountains and ice.

### Tanks
Tanks are the most effective tool for rapid capture and hard attack against dug-in troops. The tank is extremely effective on flat land, as found in Europe, North America or East Asia.

### Anti-Air
The Anti Air is the only ground unit that can fight against air troops. However, it is quite useless against other ground troops and should therefore be used as support.

### Artillery
Artillery can be researched with anti-air under the "Support" tab to make it better. The artillery can do great damage to ground units from far away.

> Tips on ground units:
> Prioritize on anti-tank weapons for the infantry, as they then have the ability to counter tanks very well.

## Ships
### Frigate
The Frigate has a medium range, is cheap, but does little damage. It is good in the early game or as a decoy.

### Destroyer
The Destroyer has a medium range, costs a bit more than the Frigate but does a lot of damage. The destroyer is the hard counter to submarines and can stop and kill enemy troops on the water.

### Battleship
The Battleship is the most important module of a good Navy. It can counter destroyers and aircraft carriers, but is countered by the submarine. The battleship has a medium range, withstands a lot of damage and does the most damage after the aircraft carrier.

### Submarine
The submarine is the nightmare of every ship except the destroyer. The submarine can only be seen by enemies when it is attacking or when an enemy sonar station is near it. It is the best tool to stop invasions over water. So it doesn't hurt to put a pair of them on the shore for readiness.

### Aircraft Carrier
The aircraft carrier is the best ship in a Navy fleet. It has the longest range and does extreme damage. The main reason to have an aircraft carrier is so that planes can refuel on it and to kill enemy armies very quickly.

> Tips on ships:
> Prioritize on Naval Guns and Naval Protection in the Technology Tree.
<br />

## Aircraft
### Fighters
Fighters are very good at eliminating other aircraft from the air. This is all their use.

### Attacker
Attackers are very good at killing ground or water units very quickly. More are always better than one, but Attackers are eliminated very quickly by fighters or anti-air.

### Bombers
Bombers are good at destroying the enemy player's industry in long wars. However, Bombers are better at setting cities on fire, bringing the enemy to their knees.

> Tips on aircraft:
> Prioritize Rockets, as they are best for all aircraft.
